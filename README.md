# COVID-19-Data-Mining
Used data mining principles to analyze data related to symptoms, number of cases,population mobility and policies implemented and severity in countries across the world. 
Performed cluster-wise analysis of different countries to suggest policy impolementations that could effectively reduce the spread
Specific policy data analysis for Hong Kong and Singapore
Constructed a network using Networkx based on past case history and population density of countries(nodes)
Compared closely connected nodes and suggested potentially effective policies 
Used association rule mining to find combination of activities that can predict higher than median cases as a % of population
Used clustering on activities data to guide policy suggestions
Created a neural network to classify countries according to severity
